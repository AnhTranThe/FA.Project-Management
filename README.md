<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a personal project for practicing skills and it is not intended to work as a real Jira application. It is still in early development and some features and improves are coming.

For pragmatic purposes, many features are not included. Others have been modified according to my tastes. The application should serve the basic functionalities of a project management software. I have taken inspiration from the actual [Jira Website](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), as well as from [Trello](https://trello.com/vi).

[LIVE DEMO]()
